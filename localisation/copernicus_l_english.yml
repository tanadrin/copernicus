 pc_gc_star:0 "G-class star"
 pc_gc_star_desc:0 "G-type main sequence stars have 0.8 to 1.2 solar masses and surface temperatures between 5,300 and 6,000 K. G stars have stable habitable zones and often have numerous planets."
 pc_kc_star:0 "K-class star"
 pc_kc_star_desc:0 "K-type main sequence stars are intermediate between red dwarfs and G-type main sequence stars. They have a mass between 0.45 and 0.8 solar masses and surface temperatures between 3,900 and 5,200 K. They are longer-lived and more stable than G-type stars, and far more abundant."
 pc_mc_star:0 "M-class star"
 pc_mc_star_desc:0 "M-type main sequence stars are also known as red dwarfs. They have a mass from 0.075 to 0.50 solar masses and surface temperatures of less than 4,000 K. They are numerous but hard to detect from a distance, rarely visible to the naked eye from Earth, but are extremely long-lived."
 pc_lc_star:0 "Brown dwarf"
 pc_lc_star_desc:0 "L, T, and Y-class dwarfs are very low-mass sub-stellar objects that lie in the range between the largest gas giants and the smallest stars, from 13 to 80 Jupiter masses. They cannot sustain normal hydrogen fusion, but can fuse deuterium if their mass is sufficient."
 pc_earth:0 "Human homeworld"
 pc_earth_desc:0 "Earth is the prototype for human-habitable worlds: warm and wet, with a dense atmosphere. It is not yet certain how common worlds like Earth might be in the galaxy at large, much less how likely they are to host native life of their own."
 pc_moon:0 "Rocky world"
 pc_moon_desc:0 "The Moon is approximately the same age as the Earth, and among the largest natural satellites in the Solar System. It is tidally locked to its parent world, and has been one of the first and most important targets of human space exploration."
 pc_mars:0 "Rocky world"
 pc_mars_desc:0 "Mars is a small, rocky planet with a thin atmosphere, and inhospitable to life. Its low gravity and the large quantity of water ice beneath its surface makes it one of the few attractive places for colonization in the inner Solar System."
 pc_jupiter:0 "Gas giant"
 pc_jupiter_desc:0 "The largest planet in the Solar System, Jupiter is an immense gas giant. Like all such worlds, it is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a dense, rocky core. Jupiter is notable for its large moon system and its powerful magnetic field."
 pc_uranus:0 "Ice giant"
 pc_uranus_desc:0 "Uranus is an ice giant with an extreme axial tilt, and numerous small, icy moons. Like all ice giants, it is comprised of small amounts of hydrogen and helium, and has a thick mantle of water, methane, and ammonia."
 pc_neptunian:0 "Ice giant"
 pc_neptunian_desc:0 "Ice giants are a sub-type of gas giants. Although they have hydrogen and helium in their atmospheres like all gas giants, they have far greater quantities of water, ammonia, and methane ices."
 pc_jovian:0 "Gas giant"
 pc_jovian_desc:0 "Gas giants are large planets composed primarily of light elements with low boiling points. Despite the name, most of the body of gas giants is in fact under immense pressure, and there is little distinction between gases and liquids in the planets' interior."
 pc_earthlike:0 "Earthlike world"
 pc_earthlike:0 "Earthlike planets are a narrow category of small, warm, rocky worlds with atmospheres dense enough for liquid water to flow, but not so dense as to be crushing or to trap massive amounts of heat. An earthlike world with the right chemical composition, and liquid water at the surface, might well host alien life. But that doesn't  mean humans will always find it comfortable."
 pc_rocky_airless:0 "Rocky world"
 pc_rocky_airless_desc:0 "Inside the frost line, gases and other volatiles are stripped from the protoplanetary disk, allowing rocky planitesimals to condense into larger worlds without being shrouded in crushingly thick gas envelopes, or submerged beneath miles-deep oceans. Such small worlds can rarely form at atmosphere, or hold on to one for long."
 pc_rocky_airless_hab:0 "Rocky world"
 pc_rocky_airless_hab_desc:0 "Inside the frost line, gases and other volatiles are stripped from the protoplanetary disk, allowing rocky planitesimals to condense into larger worlds without being shrouded in crushingly thick gas envelopes, or submerged beneath miles-deep oceans. If they are small, such worlds can rarely form an atmosphere, or hold on to one for long."

 pc_icy_airless:0 "Icy world"
 pc_icy_airless_desc:0 "Further from a parent star, grains of methane, water ice, and ammonia condense along with rocky material to form worlds made up of roughly equal ratios of ice and rock. If they are small, such worlds can rarely form an atmosphere, or hold on to one for long."
 pc_icy_airless_hab:0 "Icy world"

 pc_asteroidc:0 "Asteroid"
 pc_asteroidc_desc:0 "Many minor planets and small moons are too small for hydrostatic forces to form them into even remotely round shapes. Such small, irregular bodies have no atmosphere and very weak gravity, but may still present attractive mining opportunities."
 pc_asteroid_hab:0 "Asteroid"
 pc_asteroid_hab_desc:0 "Many minor planets and small moons are too small for hydrostatic forces to form them into even remotely round shapes. Such small, irregular bodies have no atmosphere and very weak gravity, but may still present attractive mining opportunities."

 pc_temperate_region:0 "Temperate continent"
 pc_temperate_region_desc:0 "Most of the arable land on this continent is found in temperate regions, with strong seasonal variations in both rainfall and temperature."
 pc_cold_region:0 "Cold continent"
 pc_cold_region_desc:0 "This continent has little arable land, and is generally quite cold. Only latent mineral wealth or extreme population pressure makes it an attractive settlement option."
 pc_rocky_airless_region:0 "Rocky wastes"
 pc_rocky_airless_region_desc:0 "Settlement of barren, airless worlds requires the construction of extensive artificial habitats, or the excavation of subterranean caverns. Although difficult and expensive at first, such colonies can be made self-sufficient in time."
 pc_icy_airless_region:0 "Icy wastes"
 pc_icy_airless_region_desc:0 "Settlement of barren, airless worlds requires the construction of extensive artificial habitats. Although difficult and expensive at first, such colonies can be made self-sufficient in time. Large quantities of local water considerably ease this process."

 START_SCREEN_EU:0 " The fortunes of Europe have risen and fallen many times over the centuries: from Rome to Charlemagne, from the Black Death to the Age of Exploration, Europe has contended with many catastrophes and crises, and her peoples have often occupied the center stage in world affairs. The rise of the European Union out of the ashes of World War II sought to make another great war on that continent impossible, a daunting task at which Europe's architects very nearly succeeded. In the aftermath of what some are already calling the third world war, Europe has been reborn as a single state, a federation of countries that cannot help but recognize their common history and their shared destiny. In return for sacrificing some measure of their independence, the various countries that make up Europe are determined to be able to stand toe-to-toe with the giants of the Americas and Asia. As a new Age of Exploration dawns, Europe's scientists, adventurers, and explorers look heavenward, and prepare to set sail."

 START_SCREEN_NAFTA:0 " The people of North America have long mythologized themselves as pioneers and doughty frontiersman, even long after the drive to settle the west was over, and the native inhabitants of the continent had been driven out and pacified. Nonetheless, a certain spirit of independence still reigned, transmuted from the hazards of the frontier to the ambitions of the marketplace. The rise of the Neo-Corporatist ideology and the fading significance of national governments in an era of truly global commerce has resulted in a de facto transformation of life in the North American Free Trade Area. Nations, states, and patriotism are things of the past; it is the corporate hierarchy, the private fiefs carved out of various sectors of the economy, that rule in America now. And no one need worry that the promise of a new frontier will mean returning to the ways of the distant past: the pioneers of the future are to be found in boardrooms and executive suites now, and their greed, as well as their ambition, may well be limitless."

 START_SCREEN_MERCOSUR:0 " South America has always had something of the radical spirit: a combination of the explorer's ambition, perhaps, and the peasant's hard-won experience. The meteoric rise of the Argentine and Brazilian economies in the late 20th century suppressed the radicalism of the south only temporarily; when the promise of prosperity proved, ultimately, to be unstable, the Rebirth movement was ready to experiment again with the revolutionary methods of the past. The result has been an attempt at Utopia that has lasted longer than most, driven by an ideology that crosses political and linguistic boundaries, and has overwhelmed three-quarters of the continent. But the leaders of MERCOSUR are not content with revolution at home. They are casting their eyes further afield now: to the north, across the ocean, and beyond."

 START_SCREEN_AFRICA:0 " One hundred years ago, the idea that Africa, fragmented and still recovering from centuries of colonialism, could come together in a single powerful transnational union seemed like a pipe dream at best. And though the road has by no means been easy, the people of this vast continent have remained undaunted. The African Union, though still a loose confederation in many respects, has proven itself to be the equal of Europe and North America, and the Union has long desired to prove itself on a wider stage. The opening of the Solar System may give it just the opportunity it has been hoping for."

 START_SCREEN_SAARC:0 " South Asia has been the seat of empires since the dawn of time, and if the bureaucrats and oligarchs who are in charge of the SAARC have their way, it will soon be the seat of a new empire. Nothing so crass as an empire of conquest, mind you, but an empire of commerce and technology and science that will rival the splendor and the fame of the Mughals, the Mauryas, the Guptas, and the British Raj combined. Australia, Indochina, and the Middle East have already fallen under the SAARC's sway; soon, perhaps, whole worlds will follow."

 START_SCREEN_PACIFIC:0 " In the grand scheme of history, China could remain eclipsed only for so long. All systems have their natural equilibrium; history is no different, and the resurgence of China in the 21st century was in that regard inevitable. The difference is that now China stands, not as the conqueror and suzerain of surrounding peoples, but their champion, the leader, alongside Korea and Japan, of a political compact designed to protect the interests of the nations of East Asia and the Pacific. The leaders of this alliance are not about to repeat the mistakes of the past, to look inward and to stagnate while more ambitious princes turn their gaze toward distant sources of wealth. No, this time China and the Compact will lead the way, and the rest of the world had better do their best to follow."

 START_SCREEN_ORBITECH:0 " Since the beginning of the Space Age, there has been a small group of visionaries who have always known that the destiny of the human race was going to be found among the stars. Alas, the struggle has been to fulfill that destiny in the face of small-minded politicians and the petty concerns of a short-sighted society. In truth, it was never going to be academics and government scientists who opened up a new frontier, since such a great work requires men of action and vision, women who are not afraid to put their hearts and their very souls on the line. Such men and women have led Orbitech to the cutting edge of asteroid mining and space exploration, and created a commercial empire with a yearly budget bigger than all but the largest of sovereign states. But there is always more work to be done."

Their apotheosis has been in AlphaCorp, the beginning and the end in global computing, communications, and electronic innovation. Though a latecomer to space-based industry, AlphaCorp has proven itself the equal of established conglomerates, animated as it is by its founder's vision of a single transcendent future. Whether that future has room for anything in it besides AlphaCorp remains to be seen."

Still unrecognized by any U.N. member state, the diverse colonists of Mars are united by their refusal to give up on their dream: freedom from the tyrannical governments of Earth, in order to pursue the creation of a new world, and a new future, not shackled to five thousand years of terrestrial history. Whether this will be a single, aberrant episode in the history of human civilization or the beginning of a new era is anyone's guess."
